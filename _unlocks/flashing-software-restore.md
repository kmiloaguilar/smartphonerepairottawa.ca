Flashing is the process of updating the firmware of the equipment. The firmware is the "operating system" that controls the phone. Flashing consists 99% of the time of updating the equipment to a newer version. It is practically used to gain new functions, improve stability or eliminate errors.Old restore points are removed to prevent the hard drive from filling up. System Restore backs up system files with certain extensions (.dll, .exe, etc.), and saves them for later restoration and use.
