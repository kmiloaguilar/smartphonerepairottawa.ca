The batteries are the lung of our devices, and the average lifespan, which can be between 500 to 1000 charge / discharge cycles.  If you have a problem with the charging time of your phone, you urgently need a new battery! We have to be careful with the type of battery we buy for our devices since most of them claim to be new and original but in reality their performance is very low without counting that we can put our health at risk.That is why we offer you quality service at an excellent price!
